# Studentifier

Parking barrier application whose purpose is to control incoming cars.

## How it works?

If the incoming car is in the database, then car is added to the daily report (visitors in the current day) along with the scan time.
On the other hand if the licence plate is not in the database then it is possible to call the caretaker or scan the OR code (only if the person if from the relevant institution).

The application flow is shown in the diagram below.
